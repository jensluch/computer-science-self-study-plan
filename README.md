Computer Science Self Study Plan
============

> “Plan Your Work And Work Your Plan.” - Napoleon Hill

My personal guide to learning fundamental and advanced Computer Science subjects.  The purpose of this plan is to create a solid foundation as a Software Engineer. This repo will only include computer science learning material, I removed all the job searching and preparation material and will create a new repo for that. 

The best way to get better at something is by working on projects and creating things. I'll be creating a repo that will have projects ideas based on different CS topics. It will have links to different material to help with projects.
